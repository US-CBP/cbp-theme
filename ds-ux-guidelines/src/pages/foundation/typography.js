          Why is Typography important in the CBP Design System?
        </h2>

        <p className="cbp-body">
          At CBP, all of our applications and websites serve a singular purpose,
          "communication." Strip away all of the images and user interface
          elements and what you’re left with is raw content. Having a well
          thought-out and managed typography system drives retention and
          understanding of information, and helps our users focus on the
          informed decisions that keep our country safe.
        </p>
        <p className="cbp-body">
          This isn’t simply what typeface we would like to use, but also the
          hierarchy, treatments, spacial relationships, and other refinements
          which augment legibility. The typographic settings we create have
          consequences for every component and page we build. At its core, the
          CBP Design System values consistency, accessibility, and legibility
          above all other style considerations.

        <p className="cbp-body">
          For our internal CBP customers we provide an enterprise CDN (content
          delivery network) mechanism for calling our font files. This allows
          our end users to easily cache these files and prevents the need to
          call them repetitively when loading the page. Please visit our
          internal Confluence site or contact the Common Framework Team to
          receive assistance with calling assets from our servers (sorry we
          can't put this link on the open web). Internal CBP applications should
          never be directly referencing the Google&trade; directory when calling
          font files.
        </p>

        <p className="cbp-body">
          For local installation, please download the following folder of
          .ttf(truetype) formatted files and install them on your machine (you
          may require assistance from your IT dept. in some instances to install
          local files).

        <p className="cbp-body">
          Because Google&trade; is constantly revising and improving these files
          you can visit the Google&trade; Fonts website to follow the
          instructions for downloading the most up-to-date font files. This will
          keep your local files up-to-date. We will periodically update the
          files hosted on our CDN and the folder above to make sure we are
          taking advantage of new efficiencies.
          <strong> Remember to download the complete font families.</strong>

          A note for CBP Design System users who are self-hosting font files.
          Please remember to only provide the .woff (IE 9+ compatibility) and
          .woff2 (all modern browsers) file types when hosting. Remove any
          reference to extraneous filetypes like .eot, .svg, etc. as this can

          Modular scales bring order, harmony, and meaning to typography. They
          reinforce a visual cadence in text sizing that allows the reader to
          quickly understand information structure and improves legibility.
          Instead of simply increasing size by an even interval (+2px) between
          each step we apply a ratio (1.125). This creates more distinct
          typography classes and creates a clearly identifiable hierarchy.
          Because the vast majority of CBP applications are"productive" in
          nature (see Reference & Research section for more information) the CBP
          Design System utilizes a ratio on the lower end of the spectrum, Major
          Second (1.125).

        <p className="cbp-body">
          When the original CBP Theme 1.X was created there was a conscious
          choice to use a widely accepted typeface in selecting Roboto from
          GoogleTM Fonts. It is well-tested, even if not fully featured. The
          type scale is mostly consistent with one noticeable blip when moving
          from Heading 2 to Heading 1. There were also some great strides in
          improving performance removing extraneous file types and moving the
          font files to a CDN to allow caching in later iterations. While this
          was a great start there are some significant issues however. There is
          little to no variability in font weight (light, regular, bold) in the
          different heading levels, and with the combined even and small step
          difference between headings, hierarchy can be difficult to
          distinguish. There some noticeable oversights in not optimizing line
          height, line length, and other micro-typography settings to enhance
          legibility.
        </p>

        <p className="cbp-body">
          The existing type-scale follows a more traditional diatonic format
          (think Microsoft word or email editors), which normally moves up the
          scale in a “step-like fashion”. Starting with adding 1px between
          steps, then 2px, and so forth. Always with even steps. Ours has some
          noticeable differences at the ends of the scale. +3 at the beginning
          and +6 at the top create a disturbance in that natural progression.

          It is a certainty that there will be a length of time where both the
          CBP Theme 1.X and the CBP Design System will be in use across the
          enterprise concurrently. In order to create some synergy between them,
          and not create a visual schism between different applications until
          they can update to the Design System, we have made design decisions to
          make this transition as smooth as possible while bringing more modern
          techniques into the fold. The proposed typography changes, while
          having a lot in common with the CBP Theme 1.X, will be a significant
          move forward for the enterprise and constitute a system-breaking
          change. This was a big part of the decision we made to create a new
          Design System rather than continue to iterate in place.

          Roboto has proven to work well with our systems provided the

          What needs revision as part of the design system is what weights,
          sizing, and other previously overlooked settings will need to be
          prescribed in order to make an efficient, hierarchical system. Near
          the end of the theme 1.X life cycle we introduced the Roboto Mono
          weight for tabulation, eliminated superfluous type files, and moved
          our font files to a CDN solution. To maintain consistency for our IE
          users we will continue to offer the .woff file type, but will focus on
          the .woff2 as it is widely accepted in modern browsers.

          dominance then your users may have issues reading any text over 2 or 3

          Modular scales are expressed as ratios between one step and the next.
          This fixes the relationship between levels of typographical hierarchy
          and its adjacent steps up and down creating distinctive appearances
          between levels that are not next to each other. This aids our users in
          understanding content structure better than fixing that hierarchical
          relation to an even interval like diatonic systems. We see these types
          of relationships throughout nature but for the sake of this argument
          are more closely linked to the types of scales you might find in sheet
          music.

        <p className="cbp-body">
          This particular concept has a lot to do with whether or not your type
          system adapts to the function of the page it is living on. In dense
          applications you want a smaller type scale and settings that reflect
          the hierarchy needed to make that flow work (productive). In more
          informationa l sites like blogs a larger ratio exists between type
          steps (Expressive).
        </p>
        <p className="cbp-body">
          In productive sites the relationship between elements on a page
          becomes a lot more important because it impacts the intended
          work-flow. Therefore having wild gaps in type steps may cause too
          great a disruption when re-flowing the page between breakpoints and
          across devices.

        <p className="cbp-body">
          In expressive sites the pages usually have a lot more text content and
          may rely more heavily on size relationships to create hierarchy and
          pull special emphasis to certain type areas. Having smaller text
          across the board in an editorial style site can actually hurt
          legibility because the hierarchy may not be immediately discernible.
        </p>
        <p className="cbp-body">
          In a system that may need to exist across these boundaries do we
          maintain two different sets of type scales and special type classes
          for each side of the coin? Or do we maintain a consistent set of
          standards regardless of site purpose? Usually the simplest answer is
          best. For now we present a single set of typographic choices with a
          the addition of two"Masthead" type classes to help account for the
          instances in which we need larger typographic choices.

        <p className="cbp-body">
          There are 8 main scales that typographic systems employ. These range
          from 1.067 (Minor Second) through 1.618 (the Golden Ratio). Three of
          these systems are suitable for use in productive systems like CBP
          develops. The rest have much more severe changes between hierarchical
          levels and are only really suitable for expressive type systems. This
          limits are selection to testing on Minor Second (ratio of 1.067),
          Major Second (ratio of 1.125), and Minor Third (ratio of 1.2).

        <p className="cbp-body">
          There have been a lot of studies in recent years about what the
          optimal base copy size should be. Most browsers and the big names in
          tech like Google&trade; pretty much unanimously decreed 16px as the
          best body copy size (for mobile). This is all relative to the distance
          from the viewport to your eyes. Much like how the"standard" size for
          body copy in books is around 12pt. That choice is related to the
          average distance a book is legible by a person with average eyesight
          at arm's length. This same principle applies to products like
          billboards which must be legible at a great distance and often at high
          speeds. In this case this means that text must be much bigger by
          comparison in order to remain legible.

        <p className="cbp-body">
          In an enterprise like CBP where the number of devices a digital
          product can appear on continues to grow beyond traditional desktop
          computers into mobile devices, wearables, and large wall- mounted
          displays we have to craft a system that remains legible in different
          sorts of scenarios.
        </p>

        <p className="cbp-body">
          Is the industry standard 16px right for our needs? In the case of
          these studies they want to remain relevant in a world that is
          increasingly mobile-first so the recommendation of 16px is directly
          related to viewing content on mobile handheld devices and the
          distances generally associated with holding them. But these studies
          are also more centered on expressive type applications and sites.
          Productive systems (which are the vast majority of CBP systems) are
          much more space- conscious, and much more sensitive to wild swings in
          responsive behavior when reflowing content up and down the viewport
          width range.
        </p>

        <p className="cbp-body">
          This gives a little flexibility when choosing a base font size that
          fits our particular needs as an enterprise. During our initial
          research, we tested a range of base font sizes from 13px (the CBP
          Theme 1.X base font size), through the industry standard 16px to see
          how this might affect a typical application design. Remember we want
          to build bridges to systems that were originally built with the CBP
          Theme. What we found was that our old 13px system just didn't hold up
          legibility wise, and 15px and 16px size effectively broke layouts and
          did not reduce as well on smaller breakpoints. That made our decision
          easy because only 1 option was left, 14px. A fitting compromise since
          it's not that far off from the existing 13px setting and gets us
          closer to the industry standard 16px. See below for some of our
          experimentation.

          inevitably clash with the system we create. Therefore the system with
          the highest probability of success has to be the 14px/major second
          scale. It forms a bridge to our predecessor theme and has a much more

          Human beings operate on identifying patterns. The"Principle of
          Repetition" brings familiarity to different items in a layout. It
          gives the layout structure. When we mix this with typography we
          enhance overall legibility because the user’s eye is allowed to flow
          smoothly, it is not interrupted by unexpected and jarring
          relationships between items in the layout.

        <p className="cbp-body">
          This is mostly manifested in what is referred to as the “Baseline
          Grid.” This grid is different from the various other terms referred to
          as grid in web design in that it specifically refers to a set of
          “invisible” lines that go down the page to which all layout elements
          are aligned. Because communication of information is at the heart of
          all websites and applications, this grid is tightly tied to our
          typography settings. Specifically to the line-height of body copy
          (because it is the base unit in our typographical system).
        </p>

        <p className="cbp-body">
          To get started, we first need to figure out what our line-height will
          be for our body copy. Earlier we established that our body copy will
          be 14px. It’s a good industry standard practice to use a 4px baseline
          grid meaning all spacing will be a multiple or factor of 4 (almost all
          device viewport widths are in multiples of 4 for some reason). 20px
          for the Body Copy line-height seems to be a good fit. This is legible
          and gives a good starting point for our spacing system (for more

          Line-height in digital design is the space which one line of text
          occupies. In print design this line goes from the line of which
          lower-case letters rest to the baseline of the next line of text. In
          digital design however, this line falls directly between lines of
          text. Earlier we arrived at a line- height of 20px for our body copy.
          Now we need to set line-height values for our other type classes.

        <p className="cbp-body">
          Headings should rarely have many lines of text (if you do then you
          should reconsider this copy). So in order to keep them from appearing
          as if they are drifting apart with their increased size, you need to
          decrease line height to around 1-1.2 times font size (it’s subjective
          we will have evaluate two values for each heading optically). A
          heading of 24px would result in line height of 24-29. We have also
          established our 4px baseline grid so we know that our line-height
          values will have to be rounded up the nearest multiple of 4. In this
          case 24px or 32px.

          The “Law of Proximity” states that when objects are close to each
          other they tend to be perceived together as part of a group. Applying
          the RIGHT spacing value between different elements is important
          because it creates, or breaks a contextual bond. The closer they are
          together the more likely they are interrelated, and conversely the
          further they are apart the less they are connected.

          Communicate that two text boxes are siblings of each other (two
          headers of equal weight but are placed together sometimes to form a
          sort of list). And also so that the user can tell that two text boxes
          are not immediately related to each other like the spacing between a

        <p className="cbp-body">
          When it comes to large blocks of text there have been several studies
          showing that people definitely have a limit to how wide a block of
          text should be. It's partly to do with how our eyes work mechanically,
          but also just how we scan content. There have been many studies on
          this subject where a general rule of between 45-85 characters fits the
          typical users needs. Any longer and it can be tiring on our eyes. Any
          shorter and reading comprehension can suffer because sentences no
          longer flow naturally. If lines are too long, readers tend to
          accidentally read the same length multiple times (also known as
          "doubling"). Essentially this has to do with our body copy classes as
          this should be the only instances where we are dealing with long
          blocks of text and multiple paragraphs. Headings should be limited in
          length by their very nature.
        </p>

        <p className="cbp-body">
          We can control control line length in two ways; the container width
          and the max-width property. When we think of responsive layouts, text
          boxes are aligned to a number of grid columns. In a situation where a
          block of paragraph text is in the context of a large screen, assigning
          col-12 (essentially full screen) would not be a great idea. The line
          length would just be too long. Choosing a smaller amount of columns
          like 4 or 5 would be much more reasonable and would result in a much
          better measure. When the viewport gets to a smaller form factor like
          phones, the text box should be 4-col (full screen) by default as
          anything less would just be too short and would result in the user not
          having a great experience. For our body copy classes we have built in
          a safety mechanism with assigning a max-width of 75em. Why em? Because
          line length essentially has nothing to do with our root settings and

          People naturally read content in a certain pattern in western
          civilizations. We start at the top-left of the page and read
          left-to-right down the page. When designing your layouts keep in mind
          how your user’s eyes will flow down the page and consume your content.
          When considering when and if to break large amounts of text up into
          columns you should keep in mind that your layouts don’t exist in a
          static viewport size. Pages essentially can scroll infinitely. We
          recommend you go through each of the major breakpoints (see more in
          the Spacing, Grid, and Layout section of foundations) and address the
          following questions:

            <li>

              text and have to scroll a long ways back up the page to get to the
              next relevant area of the page?

        <p className="cbp-body">
          The spaces between the letters are just as important as the words
          themselves. While reading, the spacing betweenindividual letters (aka
          kerning) and words is super important. If the kerning is too tight,
          letters may overlap and generally legibility is hindered. Too far
          apart and words start to blend together. The Font-kerning property
          applies certain amounts of space between individual character
          combinations. For example, when capital V and A are next to each
          other. In general we keep this property set to “normal” which means it
          applies tighter kerning at larger sizes and not on smaller sizes, but
          they also don’t have a consensus about where these boundaries are
          across browsers. In general we try to control these settings with the
          letter-spacing property. Letter- spacing (also known as tracking)
          applies space between characters uniformly. For body copy we keep this
          set to normal, as this will allow ligatures to appear. As the sizing
          of our heading classes grows however, negative letter-spacing may be
          added to keep characters from drifting from each other.

        <h3 className="cbp-heading-3">File Type Support & Self Hosting</h3>

        <p className="cbp-body">
          One"lesson learned" from our previous effort with the CBP Theme, is
          that in not centrally hosting our font files, we often forced the page
          to have to load multiple copies of the same asset. One widget
          referenced a copy of the font files, the page referenced it, then
          maybe another asset did again. This would pile on and cause our apps
          to suffer. This is not to mention that we effectively forced our
          development teams to self-host a copy. For our internal CBP
          development teams we host centralized copies of our font files so
          everything can be accessed once and allow our users to be able to
          properly cache these files.
        </p>

        <p className="cbp-body">
          We support two font file types. The .woff filetype is provided to give
          compatibility with some older versions of browsers (at some point in
          the future this may be retired). The .woff2 filetype is what modern
          browsers use. All other filetypes are not supported or endorsed for
          use with the CBP Design System. For those who are self-hosting be
          especially wary of the .eot filetype. It is somewhat sticky with users
          who for whatever reason are still using Internet Explorer, if it is
          mentioned in the stylesheet or is simply present for it to reference
          the browser will use it. Eot files have notoriously poor aliasing
          rules and will appear fuzzy and will tend to fill in negative spaces
          in certain characters. For the sake of legibility avoid this file
          type.

        <h4 className="cbp-heading-4">Text Loading</h4>

        <p className="cbp-body">
          There are few different approaches to handling the loading of text.
          When it comes to loading the specific font asset, ie Roboto, there are
          few different philosophies. We prefer the FOUT method. The reason is
          because with centrally hosting these font assets and the fact that
          most of our users with have them cached we really only have to worry
          about the content itself loading not the font. When it comes to
          content we prefer our applications to use skeleton states and
          progressive loading techniques.

        <p className="cbp-body">
          Basically in the period between when a user hits a page and when the
          font file kicks in and renders. Sometimes this can be very noticeable
          and a jarring experience for users depending on how long this
          experience is. With modern caching abilities, tweaking the load order
          of file, as well as taking a comprehensive approach to loading
          (skeleton states, progressive loading, etc) this can be mitigated or
          eliminated.

        <p className="cbp-body">
          This is an approach to dealing with FOUT by telling the browser not to
          display text at all until the font file is rendered. The issue is if
          for any reason the font file doesn’t load, the text will NEVER load.
          This runs antithetical to having fall-back fonts. Probably an approach
          to be avoided.

          has been known to at times to crash browsers. Best to just take a

        <p className="cbp-body">
          Ligatures began in the illuminated manuscripts days. By connecting
          certain common letter combinations together this helped those monks
          save time in copying their books. These letter combinations were also
          tricky for them because they would often run into each other causing
          legibility issues. By standardizing how these letters could run
          together they ended up saving time and improving overall legibility by
          keeping horizontal rhythm consistent. Common ligatures are ones like
          ff, fi, fl, ffi, ffl, and th. Enabled by default on most browsers on
          smaller text sizes (this is defined differently by each browser
          unfortunately).
          <code>Text-rendering: optimizeLegibility;</code>
          will enable ligatures and kerning but can add to load time (we believe
          this is negligible. If you set letter spacing at all in your text
          though, ligatures will be stripped out (this is why body copy is set
          to normal). Ligatures aren’t as necessary for headings because there
          shouldn't be long blocks of text.

        <p className="cbp-body">
          Small caps are smaller versions of capital letters so that they merge
          better inside of body text. These are great for acronyms and
          abbreviations. REGULAR ALL CAPS text inside of a block of text can
          cause disruption to overall horizontal rhythm as well as give the user
          a false indication that this text might be interactive."Fake small
          caps" (created by css) which just reduce the font size (including
          stroke width) is not a good solution because it interrupts flow. If
          your font does not have genuine small caps included, do not turn on
          this feature. This results in the need for a special type class for
          small caps. This class should be applied to acronyms and abbreviations
          (whether or not it has periods between letters) by enclosing the text
          in a <code>&lt;span></code> (if inside of a larger block of text) and
          applying the following class (<code>.small-cap</code>). This class is

          <p className="cbp-body">
            The main use of the em dash is to indicate the source of a quote or
            narrative placed in front of the speaker’s name. Em dashes can also
            be used in place of parentheses, or in place of a colon where a
            comma may be too little of a pause, but a period may be too much.
            This character matches the width of the capital “M” in the font.
            Ideally, the em dash should be followed by a “thin space.” (

            En Dashes are exactly half of the width of an em dash. Their main
            purpose is to replace the words “to” or “through” when used to
            indicate ranges of values or of time. For example instead of 6 to
            9pm you put 6–9pm, or instead of Los Angeles to New York (Los
            Angeles-New York). There should not be any spaces between this

          Here’s an easy way to remember which is which: l/r (means left/right),

        <strong style={{ color: "red" }}>[Image Explanation]</strong>

        <p className="cbp-body">
          All of the sizing in the typographic classes of the CBP Design System
          are sized in REM (relative EMs). Any development team that needs to
          create custom typographic classes should use rem values relative to
          the root font-size of 14px.
        </p>

        <p className="cbp-body">
          What are REM units? REM allows you to set the font-size property with
          a percentage value of font-size set to the HTML selector. If we set
          our root to 14px and size our h1 element to 3rem then the size of h1
          will be 42px (3 x 14px) etc.
        </p>

        <p className="cbp-body">
          When is it ok to use EM units? Only when the sizing of a property is
          directly related to the element you’re working with and will not
          disturb vertical rhythm. For example the max-length property on our
          body copy class is set to 75em. This is because it is directly related
          to that particular font, at that particular size. It just so happens
          that body copy is the same REM size as the root. However, when using
          REMs for max-length with a font class at another size may have
          undesirable results.
        </p>

        <p className="cbp-body">
          In order to maintain a consistent 4px baseline grid, all line-height
          settings should be expressed in intervals of 4px. Spacing between
          lines of text inside the same text box should be defined with the
          line-height property. In order to maintain a consistent 4px baseline
          grid, all line-height settings should be expressed in intervals of

            Density Independent Pixels -dp (Android ecosystem)
          </h5>

          <p className="cbp-body">
            The density- independent pixel is equivalent to one physical pixel
            on a 160 dpi screen, which is the baseline density assumed by the
            system for a “medium” density screen. The conversion of dp units to
            screen pixels is simple: px = dp * (dpi / 160). For example, on a
            240 dpi screen, 1 dp equals 1.5 physical pixels. Android has a
            separate unit for prescribing text sizing, sp. Please use that unit
            for native Android development.

            These settings are fluid type layouts (which should be a very rare

        <p className="cbp-body">
          No matter which elements you are adding to your pages, the correct
          corresponding semantic HTML element should always be utilized.
          Properly tagging text elements on the page will allow assistive
          technologies to correctly interpret all the information on the page.

        <h3 className="cbp-heading-3">Maintaining Proper Heading Structure</h3>

        <p className="cbp-body">
          The headings on your page should be semantically tagged and appear in
          descending order. Theoretically, there should only be a single H1
          element on the page (the first item present in your page’s main
          content UI region). Headings should not skip a level in descending
          order (h1 > h2 > h3 > h4 > h5 >h6). Sibling heading elements should
          use the same level semantic tag. The heading styling classes are named
          to be synonymous with the semantic heading structure. For example h1
          should be paired with heading1, h2 with heading2, etc. This is with
          the notable exception of the masthead classes which are designed to
          stand in for heading 1 when you have a need to style your page’s title
          more flamboyantly. The reason we do not style the semantic tags
          directly is because we have a need to create more than one version of
          a heading class depending on its contrasting background color.

          This is basically when you are styling two items of equal weight in

          on the page that are siblings. These h3 elements must be styled
          identically. Doing so means using the same font-weight, color, and
          other styling attributes.

          Color when it applies to text should be supplementary when it has
          specific meaning. For example if you have a link within a paragraph,
          simply making it blue is not sufficient. You need another visual cue
          that explains what meaning that color is trying to represent. Making
          that text into a heavier weight like bold and italicizing it would be
          sufficient however (as long as this approach is consistent across the
          enterprise). In order to keep text legible, text should meet minimum
          contrast ratios with the color around it. Consider using the ANDI
          browser extension to test the text on your page to ensure it meets
          minimum contrast values.
