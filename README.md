# [ALPHA] Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Design System

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/US-CBP/cbp-theme.svg?branch=design-system)](https://travis-ci.org/US-CBP/cbp-theme)

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/cbp-ds.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/cbp-ds)

The CBP Design System (2.0) exists to provide a unifying user experience and reduce redundant front-end code within the US Customs and Border Protection enterprise suite of applications and websites. This is the next evolution of our first effort, the [CBP Theme (1.X)](https://us-cbp.github.io/cbp-style-guide).

> **⚠️ The CBP Design System (2.0) is still in a stage of very active development.** As such, much of the code base is still somewhat fragile and may break at any time. While we encourage you to explore our offerings, please do so with the knowledge that the codebase in these repositories will change rapidly and with little warning. Use at your own risk. We will communicate when a stable release will be made available.

## Installation

The recommended way to get the latest CBP DS CSS is by saving as a dependency via [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/what-is-npm).

From your npm project, simply run:

- `npm install cbp-ds --save`
