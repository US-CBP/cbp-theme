# CBP HTML/CSS Framework

This is the CSS offering built upon the CBP UX Guidelines for building websites and applications. The CSS can be used with any web user interface or framework. This repo only holds the Design System codebase, all guidance for this repo will be in the [Style Guide](https://us-cbp.github.io/cbp-theme/design-system/).

This README will be updated in the future to reflect ongoing development.

> **⚠️ The CBP Design System (2.0) is still in a stage of very active development.** As such, much of the code base is still somewhat fragile and may break at any time. While we encourage you to explore our offerings, please do so with the knowledge that the codebase in these repositories will change rapidly and with little warning. Use at your own risk. We will communicate when a stable release will be made available.

### About the CBP Design System

The CBP Design System (2.0) exists to provide a unifying user experience and reduce redundant front-end code within the US Customs and Border Protection enterprise suite of applications and websites. This is the next evolution of our first effort, the [CBP Theme (1.X)](https://us-cbp.github.io/cbp-style-guide).
