It is well-tested, even if not fully featured. The\n              type scale is mostly consistent with one noticeable blip when\n              moving from Heading 2 to Heading 1. There were also some great\n              strides in improving performance removing extraneous file types\n              and moving the font files to a CDN to allow caching in later\n              iterations. While this was a great start there are some\n              significant issues however. There is little to no variability in\n              font weight (light, regular, bold) in the different heading\n              levels, and with the combined even and small step difference\n              between headings, hierarchy can be difficult to distinguish. There\n              some noticeable oversights in not optimizing line height, line\n              length, and other micro-typography settings to enhance legibility.\n            </p>\n\n            <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n              The existing type-scale follows a more traditional diatonic format\n              (think Microsoft word or email editors), which normally moves up\n              the scale in a “step-like fashion”. Starting with adding 1px\n              between steps, then 2px, and so forth.

The\n              proposed typography changes, while having a lot in common with the\n              CBP Theme 1.X, will be a significant move forward for the\n              enterprise and constitute a system-breaking change.

In\n              dense applications you want a smaller type scale and settings that\n              reflect the hierarchy needed to make that flow work (productive).\n              In more informationa l sites like blogs a larger ratio exists\n              between type steps (Expressive).\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n              In productive sites the relationship between elements on a page\n              becomes a lot more important because it impacts the intended\n              work-flow. Therefore having wild gaps in type steps may cause too\n              great a disruption when re-flowing the page between breakpoints\n              and across devices.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n              In expressive sites the pages usually have a lot more text content\n              and may rely more heavily on size relationships to create\n              hierarchy and pull special emphasis to certain type areas. Having\n              smaller text across the board in an editorial style site can\n              actually hurt legibility because the hierarchy may not be\n              immediately discernible.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n              In a system that may need to exist across these boundaries do we\n              maintain two different sets of type scales and special type\n              classes for each side of the coin? Or do we maintain a consistent\n              set of standards regardless of site purpose? Usually the simplest\n              answer is best. For now we present a single set of typographic\n              choices with a the addition of two\"Masthead\" type classes to help\n              account for the instances in which we need larger typographic\n              choices.\n            </p>\n\n            <h3 className=\"cbp-heading-3\">Choosing a scale.</h3>\n\n            <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n              There are 8 main scales that typographic systems employ. These\n              range from 1.067 (Minor Second) through 1.618 (the Golden Ratio).\n              Three of these systems are suitable for use in productive systems\n              like CBP develops. The rest have much more severe changes between\n              hierarchical levels and are only really suitable for expressive\n              type systems. This limits are selection to testing on Minor Second\n              (ratio of 1.067), Major Second (ratio of 1.125), and Minor Third\n              (ratio of 1.2).\n            </p>\n\n            {/* @TODO: image of scale comparisons */}\n\n            <h3 className=\"cbp-heading-3\">Choosing a base font size.</h3>\n\n            {/* @TODO: image of arms length comparisons maybe */}\n\n            <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n              There have been a lot of studies in recent years about what the\n              optimal base copy size should be. Most browsers and the big names\n              in tech like Google&trade; pretty much unanimously decreed 16px as\n              the best body copy size (for mobile). This is all relative to the\n              distance from the viewport to your eyes. Much like how\n              the\"standard\" size for body copy in books is around 12pt. That\n              choice is related to the average distance a book is legible by a\n              person with average eyesight at arm's length. This same principle\n              applies to products like billboards which must be legible at a\n              great distance and often at high speeds. In this case this means\n              that text must be much bigger by comparison in order to remain\n              legible.\n            </p>\n\n            <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n              In an enterprise like CBP where the number of devices a digital\n              product can appear on continues to grow beyond traditional desktop\n              computers into mobile devices, wearables, and large wall- mounted\n              displays we have to craft a system that remains legible in\n              different sorts of scenarios.\n            </p>\n\n            <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n              Is the industry standard 16px right for our needs? In the case of\n              these studies they want to remain relevant in a world that is\n              increasingly mobile-first so the recommendation of 16px is\n              directly related to viewing content on mobile handheld devices and\n              the distances generally associated with holding them. But these\n              studies are also more centered on expressive type applications and\n              sites. Productive systems (which are the vast majority of CBP\n              systems) are much more space- conscious, and much more sensitive\n              to wild swings in responsive behavior when reflowing content up\n              and down the viewport width range.\n            </p>\n\n            <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n              This gives a little flexibility when choosing a base font size\n              that fits our particular needs as an enterprise. During our\n              initial research, we tested a range of base font sizes from 13px\n              (the CBP Theme 1.X base font size), through the industry standard\n              16px to see how this might affect a typical application design.\n              Remember we want to build bridges to systems that were originally\n              built with the CBP Theme. What we found was that our old 13px\n              system just didn't hold up legibility wise, and 15px and 16px size\n              effectively broke layouts and did not reduce as well on smaller\n              breakpoints. That made our decision easy because only 1 option was\n              left, 14px. A fitting compromise since it's not that far off from\n              the existing 13px setting and gets us closer to the industry\n              standard 16px.

The\"Principle of\n              Repetition\" brings familiarity to different items in a layout. It\n              gives the layout structure. When we mix this with typography we\n              enhance overall legibility because the user’s eye is allowed to\n              flow smoothly, it is not interrupted by unexpected and jarring\n              relationships between items in the layout.\n            </p>\n\n            <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n              This is mostly manifested in what is referred to as the “Baseline\n              Grid.” This grid is different from the various other terms\n              referred to as grid in web design in that it specifically refers\n              to a set of “invisible” lines that go down the page to which all\n              layout elements are aligned. Because communication of information\n              is at the heart of all websites and applications, this grid is\n              tightly tied to our typography settings. Specifically to the\n              line-height of body copy (because it is the base unit in our\n              typographical system).\n            </p>\n\n            <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n              To get started, we first need to figure out what our line-height\n              will be for our body copy. Earlier we established that our body\n              copy will be 14px. It’s a good industry standard practice to use a\n              4px baseline grid meaning all spacing will be a multiple or factor\n              of 4 (almost all device viewport widths are in multiples of 4 for\n              some reason). 20px for the Body Copy line-height seems to be a\n              good fit. This is legible and gives a good starting point for our\n              spacing system (for more information on the spacing system please\n              see its section under foundations).\n              {/* @TODO: [**The Baseline Grid image line height body copy + good rhythm bad\n            rhythm image**] */}\n            </p>\n\n            <h3 className=\"cbp-heading-3\">Line Height Exploration</h3>\n\n            <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n              Line-height in digital design is the space which one line of text\n              occupies. In print design this line goes from the line of which\n              lower-case letters rest to the baseline of the next line of text.\n              In digital design however, this line falls directly between lines\n              of text. Earlier we arrived at a line- height of 20px for our body\n              copy. Now we need to set line-height values for our other type\n              classes.\n            </p>\n\n            <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n              Headings should rarely have many lines of text (if you do then you\n              should reconsider this copy). So in order to keep them from\n              appearing as if they are drifting apart with their increased size,\n              you need to decrease line height to around 1-1.2 times font size\n              (it’s subjective we will have evaluate two values for each heading\n              optically). A heading of 24px would result in line height of\n              24-29. We have also established our 4px baseline grid so we know\n              that our line-height values will have to be rounded up the nearest\n              multiple of 4. In this case 24px or 32px.\n              {/* @TODO: **image of heading table and differences in line height\n            understanding between web and print instances**] [**images for line\n            height exploration**] */}\n            </p>\n\n            <h3 className=\"cbp-heading-3\">\n              How spacing affects hierarchy in typography.\n            </h3>\n\n            {/* @TODO: image showing bad vs good spacing relationships */}\n\n            <p className=\"cbp-bpdy\">\n              The “Law of Proximity” states that when objects are close to each\n              other they tend to be perceived together as part of a group.\n              Applying the RIGHT spacing value between different elements is\n              important because it creates, or breaks a contextual bond.

Communicate that two text boxes are siblings of each\n              other (two headers of equal weight but are placed together\n              sometimes to form a sort of list).

It's partly to do with how our eyes work\n              mechanically, but also just how we scan content. There have been\n              many studies on this subject where a general rule of between 45-85\n              characters fits the typical users needs. Any longer and it can be\n              tiring on our eyes. Any shorter and reading comprehension can\n              suffer because sentences no longer flow naturally. If lines are\n              too long, readers tend to accidentally read the same length\n              multiple times (also known as \"doubling\"). Essentially this has to\n              do with our body copy classes as this should be the only instances\n              where we are dealing with long blocks of text and multiple\n              paragraphs. Headings should be limited in length by their very\n              nature.\n            </p>\n\n            <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n              We can control control line length in two ways; the container\n              width and the max-width property. When we think of responsive\n              layouts, text boxes are aligned to a number of grid columns. In a\n              situation where a block of paragraph text is in the context of a\n              large screen, assigning col-12 (essentially full screen) would not\n              be a great idea. The line length would just be too long. Choosing\n              a smaller amount of columns like 4 or 5 would be much more\n              reasonable and would result in a much better measure. When the\n              viewport gets to a smaller form factor like phones, the text box\n              should be 4-col (full screen) by default as anything less would\n              just be too short and would result in the user not having a great\n              experience. For our body copy classes we have built in a safety\n              mechanism with assigning a max-width of 75em. Why em? Because line\n              length essentially has nothing to do with our root settings and\n              everything to do with the exact type class we're working with.\n            </p>\n\n            <p className=\"cbp-subhead-text\">\n              <em>\n                Learn more about the CBP Design System's grid settings under the\n                <a href=\"./layouts\"> Spacing, Grid & Layout section</a> in\n                foundations.{\"\"}\n              </em>\n            </p>\n\n            <h3 className=\"cbp-heading-3\">\n              Columns, Paragraphs, and Logical Reading Order\n            </h3>\n\n            <h4 className=\"cbp-heading-4\">Logical Reading Order</h4>\n\n            {/* @TODO:  [**image of what logical reading order / maybe eye F patterns**]*/}\n\n            <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n              People naturally read content in a certain pattern in western\n              civilizations. We start at the top-left of the page and read\n              left-to-right down the page. When designing your layouts keep in\n              mind how your user’s eyes will flow down the page and consume your\n              content. When considering when and if to break large amounts of\n              text up into columns you should keep in mind that your layouts\n              don’t exist in a static viewport size. Pages essentially can\n              scroll infinitely. We recommend you go through each of the major\n              breakpoints (see more in the Spacing, Grid, and Layout section of\n              foundations) and address the following questions:\n            </p>\n\n            <div className=\"content\">\n              <ul>\n                <li>\n                  Would it be frustrating for the user read a single long column\n                  of text and have to scroll a long ways back up the page to get\n                  to the next relevant area of the page?\n                </li>\n                <li>Does the order of your content make sense?</li>\n                <li>Are you keeping line length principles in mind?</li>\n              </ul>\n            </div>\n\n            {/* @TODO: [**image of logical reading order**] */}\n\n            <h3 className=\"cbp-heading-3\">Letter Spacing</h3>\n\n            {/* @TODO: [**image explaining why this is important** */}\n\n            <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n              The spaces between the letters are just as important as the words\n              themselves. While reading, the spacing betweenindividual letters\n              (aka kerning) and words is super important. If the kerning is too\n              tight, letters may overlap and generally legibility is hindered.\n              Too far apart and words start to blend together. The Font-kerning\n              property applies certain amounts of space between individual\n              character combinations. For example, when capital V and A are next\n              to each other. In general we keep this property set to “normal”\n              which means it applies tighter kerning at larger sizes and not on\n              smaller sizes, but they also don’t have a consensus about where\n              these boundaries are across browsers. In general we try to control\n              these settings with the letter-spacing property. Letter- spacing\n              (also known as tracking) applies space between characters\n              uniformly. For body copy we keep this set to normal, as this will\n              allow ligatures to appear. As the sizing of our heading classes\n              grows however, negative letter-spacing may be added to keep\n              characters from drifting from each other.\n            </p>\n\n            <h3 className=\"cbp-heading-3\">Alignment</h3>\n\n            <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n              Alignment refers to which vertical axis type is aligned to.\n              Alignment allows a user’s eye to have a reference to return to as\n              they finish each line of text.

These letter combinations\n              were also tricky for them because they would often run into each\n              other causing legibility issues. By standardizing how these\n              letters could run together they ended up saving time and improving\n              overall legibility by keeping horizontal rhythm consistent.

Theoretically, there should only be a single\n              H1 element on the page (the first item present in your page’s main\n              content UI region). Headings should not skip a level in descending\n              order (h1 > h2 > h3 > h4 > h5 >h6). Sibling heading elements\n              should use the same level semantic tag. The heading styling\n              classes are named to be synonymous with the semantic heading\n              structure. For example h1 should be paired with heading1, h2 with\n              heading2, etc. This is with the notable exception of the masthead\n              classes which are designed to stand in for heading 1 when you have\n              a need to style your page’s title more flamboyantly. The reason we\n              do not style the semantic tags directly is because we have a need\n              to create more than one version of a heading class depending on\n              its contrasting background color.\n            </p>\n\n            <p className=\"cbp-subhead-text\">\n              <strong>WCAG Details</strong>\n              1.3.1 Info and Relationships Level A Information, structure, and\n              relationships conveyed through presentation can be\n              programmatically determined or are available in text. 1.3.2\n              Meaningful Sequence Level A When the sequence in which content is\n              presented affects its meaning, a correct reading sequence can be\n              programmatically determined.\n            </p>\n\n            <h3 className=\"cbp-heading-3\">Consistency of Presentation</h3>\n\n            <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n              This is basically when you are styling two items of equal weight\n              in your content.
