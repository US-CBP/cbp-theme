These\n              states must be applied consistently across the Design System to\n              reinforce these patterns, or we risk diluting their intended\n              effects.\n            </p>\n            {/* @TODO: [image] graphic about states */}\n\n            <h3 className=\"cbp-heading-3\">Enabled State</h3>\n            <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n              The enabled state lets the user know that an element is\n              interactive.

This allows buttons to exist without a container,\n              when necessary, to save space or create visual hierarchy while\n              still maintaining a symmetry of function. Do not use uppercase\n              letters on any element that is not interactive.

In the beginning of the web that's\n              all there was. Because of the history people have with this\n              function, we align to those expectations. This means using (insert\n              blue) color and underlining the text. No other text on the page\n              should be underlined. If you are looking to add emphasis try\n              changing the weight of the text to bold or using italics. If text\n              is underlined, the user will expect it to be interactive. Another\n              design pattern found in these types of links is the \"visited\"\n              state. This means applying the slightly altered color of (insert\n              color) to give users a hint that they have visited that link\n              before. This can prevent users from the confusion of forgetting\n              what they clicked on previously. When thinking about using the\n              visited state, consider the following:\n            </p>\n            <div className=\"content\">\n              <ul>\n                <li>\n                  When you have multiple content links near each other the\n                  visited state helps our users know what they have and have not\n                  yet reviewed.\n                </li>\n                <li>\n                  These types of links connect a user with other content, either\n                  by sending them to other pages/applications, or other regions\n                  on the same page.\n                </li>\n                <li>Elements that take action should not use this state.</li>\n                <li>\n                  The visited state should only be applied to links inside\n                  blocks of body copy text.

Usually this is coupled\n              with a change in form for the cursor.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n              All interactive elements can have a hover state, though on touch\n              devices this state will be unavailable. This treatment can be\n              applied to a part, or the whole component. A good example is a\n              card. Some cards only have one interaction associated with them,\n              so applying a hover state to the whole card makes sense. Other\n              cards may be more complicated with several different parts that\n              have separate interactions. Hover should let the user know exactly\n              which interaction they are about to select and not be ambiguous\n              about it. Hover states can be combined with active, selected, or\n              pressed states where appropriate.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n              Only one element on the page can have the hover state applied at a\n              time.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n              Some elements may incorporate a change in elevation to help\n              reinforce a hover state.\n            </p>\n\n            <Image imgName=\"interactivity-hover.png\" size=\"700px\" />\n\n            <h4 className=\"cbp-heading-4\">\n              Using Hover to Hide Elements or Functionality\n            </h4>\n            <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n              As more and more of our users interact with our products on\n              touch-enabled devices, information that is concealed behind a\n              hover state becomes problematic. This is simply because touch\n              devices do not have a hover state.

Some of these\n              interactions simply replace interactions that occur with a\n              keyboard and mouse, while others extend these products into the\n              physical world. Because we are not interacting with these products\n              in the traditional sense, either by touching or by using another\n              new method, we need to make sure these interactions are reinforced\n              with sound and haptics to give appropriate feedback. The speed of\n              interaction should match that of the input the user is giving. For\n              instance, if the user does a fast swipe to scroll on the screen,\n              the page should scroll fast and go further than if the user had\n              made a small, slow scroll.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n              When gestures are available there should be appropriate visual\n              cues to the user that something is interactive. In some cases\n              periodic user onboarding might help with this. Icons and small\n              animations are great affordances to indicate a gesture is\n              available.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n              Gestures should always align to the user's expectations and be\n              intuitive.

They usually\n              represent the main action on the page and are at the top of the\n              hierarchical food chain. As such, they are usually styled somewhat\n              differently than other like elements on the page, so as to pull\n              extra visual attention to themselves. This might be a \"buy\" button\n              on e-commerce site, a \"submit\" button on a form, or a \"sign-up\"\n              button on a newsletter. When designing your layout, take a moment\n              and think about what the main action on your page is. Can you find\n              the action item very quickly without scanning the entire page? If\n              not, think about how you can adjust your layout to make this more\n              prominent. Be careful not to make it overwhelmingly different.\n            </p>\n\n            <h4 className=\"cbp-heading-4\">Confirmation of Action</h4>\n            <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n              Some actions have consequences that are so important that we might\n              want to double check with the user that they are sure they made\n              the right selection. Normally, this is reserved for actions that\n              are destructive in nature. Meaning that once this action is taken,\n              it likely cannot be taken back. Or, in situations where that\n              action might have a significant business impact. Sometimes, this\n              manifests itself as a confirmation modal, or a confirmation page,\n              depending on its complexity.\n            </p>\n\n            <h3 className=\"cbp-heading-3\">Forms</h3>\n            <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n              These elements collect information from our users. Form fields\n              allow users to enter custom input because we cannot accurately\n              predict all of the possible entries a user might enter. There may\n              be ways to assist users by making auto-fill suggestions once they\n              begin entering information, such as when they start entering an\n              address. If you have formatting requirements or other restrictions\n              to the content (like character limits) be very explicit in your\n              instructions to the user. All form elements should have a very\n              clear label as to what piece of information it collecting. Home\n              street address and business address can mean very different\n              things.

Sometimes these allow a user to make a single choice from\n              a grouping like with a radio button or a toggle, or allow your\n              users to build groupings like with check boxes, list items, or\n              tags. There needs to be a clear distinction between which items\n              are currently selected and which are not. Labels and instruction\n              should be clear about what the consequence of the selection is,\n              and what is required before an action is able to be taken, if\n              applicable.\n            </p>\n\n            <h3 className=\"cbp-heading-3\">Navigation</h3>\n            <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n              Any well-designed site or application is all about having\n              information organized in a way that makes sense.

Links featured inside page content may\n                  also allow similar navigation, but should not be the primary\n                  way to do so.\n                </li>\n\n                <li>\n                  <span role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"4\">\n                    <strong>Content navigation: </strong>\n                  </span>\n                  Moving between pages in a form, hitting the next or previous\n                  button on something like a data table, etc. allows our users\n                  to move between large sets of connected content within a\n                  single page of an application or site.\n                </li>\n              </ul>\n            </div>\n            <p className=\"cbp-subhead-text\">\n              For more information about Navigation, please see its page in the\n              Foundations section <a href=\"navigation\">here.</a>\n            </p>\n\n            <h3 className=\"cbp-heading-3\">Manipulation</h3>\n            <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n              These types of elements allow the user to change what content\n              appears on the page or how it is formatted. It might be something\n              like turning on or off content, like a switch. You might filter\n              the content by making selections on different categories of\n              content to show or hide. Or sorting content by a measure like\n              dates, quantity, or alphabetically. These actions should be\n              non-destructive and allow the user to undo or change their\n              decision. There needs to be sufficient visual cues about what type\n              of manipulation is currently applied, as this will hint to the\n              user they have some ability over how to change it.\n            </p>\n\n            <h3 className=\"cbp-heading-3\">Links</h3>\n            <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n              Links allow us to give our users shortcuts to content housed\n              elsewhere. Sometimes these lead somewhere else on the same page\n              (anchor links). Sometimes these lead to other parts of the same\n              site or application. Links that lead to external sites or\n              applications should be demarcated with iconography (specifically\n              the{\" \"}\n              <a href=\"https://fontawesome.com/icons/external-link\">\n                external link icon\n              </a>\n              ) letting the user know we are about to send them somewhere\n              outside of the application or site they are currently in. As well\n              as opening this type of link in a new tab. This will allow our\n              users to have a reference back to where they were without hitting\n              the browser's back button and help keep them from getting lost.\n            </p>\n\n            <h3 className=\"cbp-heading-3\">Search</h3>\n            <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n              Search is a complicated matter. It can act as navigation, a\n              filtering mechanism, or as an escape hatch depending on where it\n              is located within the layout. Search should be as flexible as\n              possible, allowing in a wide range of inputs to help users find\n              the information they need without getting stuck on formatting\n              their query. For example, accounting for user input errors like\n              spelling or punctuation variation, looking for synonyms, or not\n              being dogmatic about character formatting of the search input.\n            </p>\n\n            <h4 className=\"cbp-heading-4\">Be Flexible (Postel's Law)</h4>\n            <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n              Also known as the Robustness Principle, Postel's law is basically\n              about being flexible and being the least restrictive you can be,\n              without compromising the product. Be liberal in what you accept,\n              conservative in what you send. In terms of search, this means not\n              being so dogmatic about word order, spelling, punctuation, or\n              other formatting so that the user can find what they need instead\n              of a set of results that don't match with their expectations.\n              \"Fuzzy\" search is a good example of this where users can misspell\n              words or enter synonyms to find what they need. Autofill can also\n              assist users with finding what they need and proactively try to\n              eliminate user-error before a search is executed.\n            </p>\n\n            <h4 className=\"cbp-heading-4\">Search Placement</h4>\n            <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n              Where the search bar is located is an important cue as to what\n              information is being searched against. Placing the search bar in\n              the application header gives the impression to the user that\n              results will encompass anything on the site or application.\n              Placing it in the content area of the page hints that results will\n              be relegated to that specific pages' content. Placement and visual\n              context let the user have a rough idea of the data set they will\n              be searching against. Think carefully about where you will place\n              your search functionality when crafting your layouts.\n            </p>\n\n            <h4 className=\"cbp-heading-4\">Safety Hatch Problem</h4>\n            <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n              It is a common practice to put a search bar in your application\n              header to allow users to \"escape\" when they get lost. If you find\n              that this is being used heavily, using analytics and user testing,\n              you may have an issue with your navigation and information\n              architecture. Obviously, people aren't able to find the pages they\n              need easily. On simple sites and applications with a few pages or\n              less this escape hatch should be entirely unnecessary.\n            </p>\n\n            <h3 className=\"cbp-heading-3\">Passive Interaction</h3>\n            <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n              These types of interactions are generally not direct, conscious\n              choices by the user. Normally, it's from something they have set\n              up prior and now through the normal course of business they are\n              sending input to the system. Wearables are a good example of this,\n              where the simple act of walking, exercising, etc. sends data back\n              to a system. Where appropriate, notifications or messaging should\n              be clear about what input was received, and what actions the\n              system is making on their behalf.\n            </p>\n\n            <hr />\n\n            <h2 className=\"cbp-heading-2\">\n              Distinguishing Interactive Elements From the Rest of the Page\n            </h2>\n            <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n              There are many times where the weight of the decision created by\n              clicking a button in one of our systems can have serious\n              consequences. That's why having clear, intuitive design\n              distinctions between elements that are informative, and those that\n              are interactive is so important. A user should be readily able to\n              distinguish which elements on the page are interactive, and what\n              the consequences of those interactions are.\n            </p>\n\n            <h3 className=\"cbp-heading-3\">Meaningful Application of Color</h3>\n            <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n              Much like making certain typographical choices, sizing, or other\n              methods of establishing a hierarchical layout, color plays an\n              important role. Especially the consistent application of color.\n              Within the CBP Design System there a small handful of colors that\n              have \"jobs.\" They communicate a specific idea to our users that an\n              element is interactive, what its current state is, or that there\n              is something wrong. Do not mix colors to match brands or create a\n              unique environment just for your app. Just as with any other\n              affordance, these ideas are only easily recalled by our users\n              because they are repeatedly exposed to them in a consistent way.\n              For our CBP enterprise users, the CBP Design System was not\n              created to be \"theme-able.\" We want all of our users to encounter\n              the same set of rules for any app they may visit within the\n              enterprise.

Applying a color overlay (a semi-transparent percentage\n              of the color assigned to that particular state) on top of the\n              surface can help reinforce the interaction and what its current\n              state is. Only one of these overlays should be applied at a time.\n              For instance, on an active element only display the hover overlay\n              not the active one (provided it can actually be interacted with\n              again). Overlays should be adjusted percentage wise to maintain\n              accessibility depending on the particular color of the surface\n              being applied to.\n            </p>\n\n            <Image imgName=\"interactivity-colorOverlay.png\" size=\"700px\" />\n            <Image imgName=\"interactivity-colorOverlay2.png\" size=\"700px\" />\n\n            <h3 className=\"cbp-heading-3\">Interactive States</h3>\n            <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n              One aspect unique to interactive elements are that through user\n              interaction the elements physically transform into different\n              states.

There's no cursor to\n              give us a hint what we're selecting and often on touch devices our\n              fingers are obscuring the view of the object we're trying to\n              touch. How do we give appropriate feedback to our users that the\n              system has accepted their input? Using sounds and vibrations\n              (referred to as haptics) we can make sure that the system is\n              giving timely feedback in this kind of environment. These\n              attributes are still subject to standardized formatting, making\n              sure we are giving a consistent experience. Actions that are\n              positive or neutral in nature have a certain tone and vibration\n              that is distinct from an action that might be destructive in\n              nature like delete.

Good design can reduce overall\n              cognitive load. The goal here is to simply make sure that design\n              doesn't add unnecessary load to the user.

A\n              site can be pretty, but after struggling enough times to find what\n              you need, that feedback will rise to the top.\n            </p>\n\n            <h3 className=\"cbp-heading-3\">Germane Cognitive Load</h3>\n            <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n              Humans are, at our core, pattern-recognition machines. Germane\n              cognitive load is the amount of mental capacity devoted to\n              understanding patterns in information architecture. Why are these\n              items grouped together? How much time do I devote to knowing where\n              in the hierarchy of the site I currently am, and how do I navigate\n              to this other area of the site? Just like with intrinsic load,\n              this wanes over time with repeated exposure. You should be careful\n              about making significant changes to the navigation and\n              organization of an application as it can increase the cognitive\n              load of the user before they become accustomed to the new pattern.\n            </p>\n\n            <hr />\n\n            <h2 className=\"cbp-heading-2\">\n              Designing for Limited Mental Bandwidth\n            </h2>\n\n            <h3 className=\"cbp-heading-3\">Recognition vs. Recall</h3>\n            <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n              Recognition is preferable because it involves more cues than\n              recall for the user to understand the meaning of a piece of\n              information or action. This helps reduce cognitive load on our\n              users becuase they intuitively know what is expected of them. This\n              is why mulitple choice drop downs can be more effective than an\n              open text field. The user doesn't have to search their memory for\n              the answer, but instead recognizes the correct choice quickly from\n              a list of possible selections.\n            </p>\n\n            <h4 className=\"cbp-heading-4\">Miller's Law</h4>\n            <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n              Miller's Law states that the average person can only keep 7 items\n              (+/-2) in their working memory.

Over time, with exposure to other digital\n              products, users form perceptions about how certain types of\n              interactions are supposed to work. For the most part a lot of\n              expectations users have will be shared with the general\n              population, but in the end every person possesses their own set of\n              mental models. As an enterprise this presents us with a unique\n              opportunity to mold the expectations of our users. We can choose\n              to adopt these existing mental models to a degree and use them to\n              our advantage. Or, we can choose to buck the trend to make\n              something unique.

People get\n              used to bad UI all the time. Don't let familiarity necessarily\n              equate to superiority. There's really no such thing as a universal\n              experience on the web but certain best practices are widely\n              accepted. That's why it is so important to have a consistent\n              experience across the CBP enterprise. We can build upon existing\n              best practices and reinforce our UX choices by repeated exposure\n              to our products.

It is encouraged to do\n              testing like A/B testing between the previous iteration of the UI\n              and the new, proposed UI to see if users get confused, lost, or\n              make errors based on these changes versus the old user interface.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n              Another way to manage added cognitive load when changing a\n              particular feature is to allow your users to continue to access\n              that familiar version while they become accustomed to the new way\n              of doing things. For example, you have a page that is heavily laid\n              out in large data tables but you are moving towards a card based\n              layout.

With user workflows the\n              inverted pyramid comes into play. At the highest level,\n              information is kept to the minimum needed for the user to make a\n              choice about where to delve more deeply. As they move down the\n              funnel, information gets more specific and options for actions\n              increase. The quicker a user needs to make a decision, the fewer\n              choices you should be giving to your user. The more deliberation\n              needed before taking an action, the less Hick's law applies.\n              Though there is still always the possibility of choice fatigue.\n            </p>\n\n            <h4 className=\"cbp-heading-4\">\n              Helpful Tips in Reducing Complexity\n            </h4>\n            <div className=\"content\">\n              <ul>\n                <li>\n                  Try simplifying choices for complex tasks by obscuring its\n                  complexity into smaller steps.

Reducing the number of perceived options can help your\n                  user process lots of options in an efficient manner. Shopping\n                  results or photo galleries are good examples of this.\n                </li>\n\n                <li>\n                  Sometimes separating or placing the most likely choices first\n                  can help your users make decisions. Make sure that you are not\n                  introducing bias into the system by simply by changing an\n                  option's serial position. Navigation is also a good example of\n                  this.

It's also more likely with fewer options that\n                  your user will be able to accomplish their goal and not get\n                  lost.

A user that can't find the\n                  appropriate option can get frustrated and give up, or make the\n                  wrong decision because the more appropriate one wasn't\n                  present.\n                </li>\n\n                <li>\n                  Having too many options with the same perceived hierarchy can\n                  lead to poor user experience too. Too many options? Maybe it's\n                  time for a card-sorting exercise to reevaluate whether your\n                  categories are efficient.

At CBP, most of the systems we build are data rich,\n              dense UIs that have very robust capabilities.

With user input, the choices we make about\n              handling complexity are mostly about how its presented, what\n              instruction is present, and the resulting behavior. When the\n              system handles the complexity on behalf of the user, there are a\n              lot of assumptions that come into play, hidden controls, etc that\n              can become problematic very easily for our users to properly\n              understand or follow.\n            </p>\n\n            <h3 className=\"cbp-heading-3\">Zeigarnik Effect</h3>\n            <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n              The Zeigarnik Effect is where users are more able to recall\n              actions that are incomplete, rather than complete.

Some users will use\n              the \"Tab\" key on their keyboard or another technology to \"tab\"\n              through these interactive elements. This sequence of moving from\n              one interactive element to another must follow logical reading\n              order. Normally this means the top-down, left-right reading order\n              should be followed, but in general this refers to the reading\n              order of the content on the page by hierarchical standards. Some\n              mobile-optimized applications may utilize a bottom navigation\n              which would put it above any content on the page in reading order\n              despite being physically below said content. Use your best\n              judgement and imagine the order in which you intend your user to\n              interact with this content. That should define your reading order.\n              Unfortunately due to the subjectivity of this criteria it can\n              never be fully automated. Try and order your elements in the DOM\n              to match tab order, rather than using the \"tabindex\" attribute to\n              force elements around as this makes your code increasingly\n              fragile.\n            </p>\n            <div className=\"content\">\n              <ol>\n                <li>\n                  Focusable components need to receive focus in an order that\n                  preserves meaning and operability only when navigation\n                  sequences affect meaning and operability.\n                </li>\n\n                <li>\n                  In those cases where it is required, there may be more than\n                  one order that will preserve meaning and operability.\n                </li>\n\n                <li>\n                  If there is more than one order that preserves meaning and\n                  operability, only one of them needs to be provided.\n                </li>\n              </ol>\n            </div>\n\n            <h4 className=\"cbp-heading-4\">Reveal on Hover</h4>\n            <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n              Revealing new content or features upon hovering presents several\n              accessibility issues.\n            </p>\n            <div className=\"content\">\n              <ol>\n                <li>\n                  The user may not have intended to trigger that interaction.\n                </li>\n\n                <li>The user may not be aware new content has appeared.</li>\n\n                <li>\n                  The new content may interfere with the user's ability to\n                  perform a task.\n                </li>\n\n                <li>\n                  The new content or functionality may be unavailable to users\n                  on other types of devices who may not accept hover as a\n                  possible state of being.\n                </li>\n              </ol>\n            </div>\n            <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n              In order to mitigate these issues, this content or functionality\n              must be dismissible, hoverable, and persistent.

This allow\n              users to skip repetitive content like navigation and go straight\n              to the main content part of the page. Usually the first tab a user\n              activates focuses on this \"hidden\" control. Skip links are usually\n              hidden until focused. If the user selects the link, focus will be\n              moved to the main content area of the page. If they move focus\n              beyond the skip link, assistive technology will begin with the\n              first element on the page (most likely navigation).

Giving instruction\n              to your user that \"fields labeled in red are required\" would not\n              be sufficient without also giving another means of indicating the\n              field is required like adding a symbol, changing text styles, or\n              labeling each individual field with the word required.\n            </p>\n\n            <h4 className=\"cbp-heading-4\">Sensory Instruction</h4>\n            <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n              In your instruction to users, do not rely on wording that would\n              only apply to users with full use of a particular sense such as\n              sight or hearing. All of the above can be tricky thing for someone\n              who is blind. Try to be more precise with your language or give\n              alternative instruction that might be picked up by assistive\n              technology to explain what you mean in a way your users can\n              understand.\n            </p>\n\n            <h4 className=\"cbp-heading-4\">Minimum Contrast</h4>\n            <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n              Just as with any element on the page that conveys information to\n              your users (text, iconography) you should be meeting or exceeding\n              the minimum contrast ratios of 4.5:1.\n            </p>\n\n            <h4 className=\"cbp-heading-4\">Images as Controls</h4>\n            <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n              You should try to avoid using images of buttons over using a\n              semantically coded one, it complicates matters more than it's\n              worth to have a specific styling.\n            </p>\n            {/* @TODO: Insert Success Criterion stuff here if required */}\n\n            <h3 className=\"cbp-heading-3\">Input Purpose Issues</h3>\n\n            <h4 className=\"cbp-heading-4\">Relevant Instruction</h4>\n            <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n              Input fields need an appropriate level of instruction so that the\n              user can readily identify what the intended purpose of the field\n              is. Visible labels and appropriate instruction help us understand\n              the function of different input fields. Programmatically\n              identifying the input type by category for example, input\n              type=\"tel\", input type=\"email\", or input type=\"password\" can help\n              give users with assistive technology cues to an input's purpose or\n              intended format when paired with a robust label and instruction.\n              Where inputs have a label visually next to it, it must also match\n              its programmatic label.\n            </p>\n\n            <h4 className=\"cbp-heading-4\">Keyboard Accessible</h4>\n            <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n              All interactive elements should be accessible by using a keyboard\n              without needing to do specific key combinations in a certain\n              amount of time. Examples of \"specific timings for individual\n              keystrokes\" include situations where a user would be required to\n              repeat or execute multiple keystrokes within a short period of\n              time or where a key must be held down for an extended period\n              before the keystroke is registered. Some types of interaction will\n              never be able to be replicated with a keyboard like freehand\n              drawing and some gaming, and those elements are exempt. There are\n              common key commands associated with certain types of interactions\n              such as the tab key allowing users to move down the tab order from\n              one interactive element to the next. Where your UI requires a\n              non-standard key command, you need to provide appropriate helper\n              text to explain its function. These keyboard shortcuts need to\n              have the option for the user to disable these functions as well.\n              Users who access your product via voice may become frustrated as\n              saying a single letter character out loud has the unintended\n              effect of activating a shortcut.\n            </p>\n\n            <h4 className=\"cbp-heading-4\">Link Purpose</h4>\n            <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n              Your users should be able to understand where a link is taking\n              them either by the text in the link, the link is contained by text\n              giving contextual clues, or programmatically by the title\n              attribute. The title for each link also must be unique. Screen\n              reader users will not have the visual cues at their disposal to\n              navigate the meaning of 5 instances of \"Learn More\" links on a\n              page. Developers need to be more descriptive here. For instances\n              where links are opening documents, books, or articles the title of\n              said product is sufficient. The CBP Design System also utilizes\n              the icon (external-link-alt) to designate a link that will lead\n              the user outside of their current application and should be\n              applied to all said links.\n            </p>\n\n            <h4 className=\"cbp-heading-4\">\n              Programatically Identifying Interactive Elements\n            </h4>\n            <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n              In addition to labels and instruction, interactive elements should\n              be programmatically identified by name, role, and value attributes\n              for assistive technologies.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n              When the system changes content based on user input and this\n              change does not receive user focus, such as a status message,\n              there is a way to identify this change with the role attribute.\n              For example as the system returns 5 results after a search is\n              conducted.
