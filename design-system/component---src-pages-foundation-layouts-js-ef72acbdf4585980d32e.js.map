In\n              this specific instance the \"Layout Grid\" we are referring to is\n              the skeleton on which different elements are placed to give the\n              overall page structure. It's made up of 3 main parts: Columns,\n              Gutters, and Margins. The CBP Design System supports 4 major\n              breakpoints: small, medium, large, and extra-large. Major\n              breakpoints are the viewport width points that are aligned to the\n              most common device resolutions (logical resolution not device\n              screen resolution). From one breakpoint to another the grid may\n              change the number of columns or the values associated with gutter\n              or margin width. From a horizontal alignment perspective, your\n              content should align to this grid. An exception to this may\n              include fluid dashboards where dividing up the page via\n              percentages is more effective. Regardless of which method is used,\n              the grid margin must be preserved. In general, you will notice\n              that the size of the gutters and margins stays static while the\n              columns grow and shrink to fit the remainder of the viewport width\n              at each major breakpoint.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n              <strong>NOTE: </strong>At a later point native mobile versions of\n              the CBP Design System will swap these pixel values for that\n              ecosystem's particular unit of measurement. For iOS this means\n              pt(s) and for Android, dp(s).\n            </p>\n\n            <h3 className=\"cbp-heading-3\">Major Breakpoints</h3>\n            <h4 className=\"cbp-heading-4\">\n              Small Break Point {`<`}599px 4 column 20px margin / 16px gutter\n            </h4>\n            <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n              This will cover the gamut of mobile devices currently in the wild.\n              Margins are slightly larger than the gutters.

The arrangement of content on the\n              page is just as important as the content itself. Placement, size,\n              and spatial relationships give the user context clues about the\n              order in which content should be consumed, and its overall\n              affiliation with the other information on the page.\n            </p>\n            <h2 className=\"cbp-heading-2\">Layout Grid</h2>\n            <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n              With an atomic design methodology in mind, layout has varying\n              levels of complexity. At the most fundamental level the \"Layout\n              Grid\" provides the cadence that establishes our horizontal rhythm.\n              When paired with the \"Baseline Grid\" established in our\n              typographic system, we have a consistent method of aligning\n              elements on the page. This simplifies design decisions and speeds\n              up the development process.\n            </p>\n            <h3 className=\"cbp-heading-3\">\n              How is this different from other grids?\n            </h3>\n            <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n              In this specific instance the \"Layout Grid\" we are referring to is\n              the skeleton on which different elements are placed to give the\n              overall page structure. It's made up of 3 main parts: Columns,\n              Gutters, and Margins. The layout grid is used to establish\n              horizontal rhythm on the page. Because we can't guarantee what the\n              viewport width our users will be experiencing our products with,\n              this grid must be inherently flexible. This is unlike the\n              \"Baseline Grid\" where we can define a explicit grid in 4px\n              increments.\n            </p>\n            <h3 className=\"cbp-heading-3\">\n              Different Kinds of Layout Grids for Different Purposes\n            </h3>\n            <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n              There are few different kinds of layout grids. Fluid grids display\n              their content in terms of ratios. Each element's width is\n              expressed as a percentage or fraction of the overall viewport\n              width usually expressed in % or FR's (fractions). To make these\n              types of layouts work everything must scale, borders, type,\n              everything. This is not ideal for the type of products we build at\n              CBP. Fixed grids display their content at a set width and the\n              margins flex to absorb the extra space. This is how most sites\n              were built in the early days of the web, but doesn't fit our needs\n              today. Hybrid or Responsive grids have aspects of both fixed and\n              fluid grids. The margin and gutters are represented as static\n              values and the columns resize fluidly to fill in the rest of the\n              space. Responsive grids also adjust these settings with media\n              queries on the viewport width to provide more appropriate options.\n              This is what most modern products utilize and best serves the\n              majority of the products CBP produces.\n            </p>\n            {/* @TODO: insert anatomy of columns, margins, gutters */}\n            <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n              <span role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"4\">\n                <strong>Columns- </strong>\n              </span>\n              These are the vertical bars that all content on the page is\n              aligned to. Columns create horizontal hierarchy on the page by\n              standardizing the starting and stopping points to which content is\n              aligned. The number of columns present is dictated by what\n              breakpoint the viewport falls within. The larger the viewport, the\n              more columns present. The width of columns is flexible depending\n              on the remaining available space after margins and gutters have\n              been allocated.\n            </p>\n\n            <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n              <span role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"4\">\n                <strong>Margins- </strong>\n              </span>\n              This is the space on the far left and right of the page that\n              creates separation between page content the edge of the viewport\n              (either browser window or device edge). Margins have a slightly\n              heavier lift than gutters. Creating a distinction between the\n              viewport and the content requires more negative space in order to\n              help the user's eye properly focus.\n            </p>\n\n            <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n              <span role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"4\">\n                <strong>Gutters- </strong>\n              </span>\n              This is the space between columns. There is a minimum value that\n              is directly tied to the REM value. This value needs to be at a\n              minimum 2REM. Why? Because 1REM would effectively be the space\n              between two words (provided text is not justified which it\n              shouldn't be). So what if you had two columns of text directly\n              next to each other? The user would read across the columns. In the\n              case of the CBP DS the REM value = 14px x2=28px. This is the\n              setting for gutters in all of the major breakpoints aside from\n              \"small\" because at this effective size there should only be one\n              column of text, eliminating the issue of columns running together.\n            </p>\n\n            <h2 className=\"cbp-heading-2\">\n              Major Breakpoints\n              <a\n                href=\"#Basics\"\n                className=\"cbp-heading-6\"\n                style={{ position: \"relative\", float: \"right\", right: \"3rem\" }}\n              >\n                Back to Top <i className=\"fas fa-arrow-up\"></i>\n              </a>{\" \"}\n            </h2>\n\n            {/* @TODO: implement image overview of breakpoints with devices in use */}\n\n            <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n              In order for our content to adapt to the screen that our users are\n              viewing it through, we must adjust how our content is laid out\n              across this spectrum of widths. We assign different values to our\n              grid settings to adjust for the width of the viewport via media\n              queries (if viewport width is {\"<\"} XXpx then etc.). These\n              boundaries created by the media queries are what we call major\n              breakpoints. For the sake of standardization and to speed up\n              development decisions, the CBP Design System contains 4 major\n              breakpoints whose width is determined by common device and\n              viewport width values. Why 4? You don't want to have too many\n              major breakpoints because it creates a lot of unnecessary work to\n              keep your layout working across them. You also don't want too few\n              because then your layouts will break when moving across the\n              spectrum of devices. The \"small\" breakpoint encompasses the vast\n              majority of smart phones (portrait orientation). \"Medium\" fits\n              most of our tablets (portrait orientation) and \"phablets.\" The\n              \"large\" breakpoint works with tablets (landscape orientation),\n              laptops, and small desktop screens. Finally the \"extra large\"\n              breakpoint works with large desktops and wall mounted displays\n              like TVs. See the full details on these breakpoints in the\n              \"Basics\" tab at the top of this page.\n            </p>\n\n            <h3 className=\"cbp-heading-3\">Responsive Design</h3>\n            {/* @TODO: add image of dos and don'ts */}\n            <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n              CBP applications and websites should be able to accommodate a\n              range of devices and viewport widths.

In most cases this means that a container\n              will have to \"reflow\" to the next \"row\". In some cases however,\n              this will mean that the element you're working with will have to\n              change form to fit at that width\n            </p>\n\n            <h4 className=\"cbp-heading-4\">Container Reflow</h4>\n            <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n              In general, inside of a breakpoint containers flex in both\n              directions to stay aligned to their assigned columns laterally and\n              vertically stretch to fit its content. Sometimes within a break\n              point, and especially between break points, content may need to\n              switch how many columns are occupied.

Some components will actually need to refactor their form\n              rather than simply adjust how many columns it occupies. For\n              example, the application the header can have a variety of content\n              inside it. Obviously, there are minimum spacing requirement\n              between elements inside the component. As the viewport shrinks\n              there is a point where there is no longer room to support the\n              content with the minimum spacing required, and this particular\n              component needs to have a fixed height. So what do you do? It will\n              have to change form and become something that fits that form\n              factor.

In\n              these more complex arrangements it likely will be better from a\n              layout perspective to set a fixed width or use min-max properties\n              to keep that flexing to a minimum, and simply align the container\n              within the columns rather to them.\n            </p>\n            {/* @TODO: add helper image */}\n\n            <h2 className=\"cbp-heading-2\">\n              When to Break the Grid\n              <a\n                href=\"#Basics\"\n                className=\"cbp-heading-6\"\n                style={{ position: \"relative\", float: \"right\", right: \"3rem\" }}\n              >\n                Back to Top <i className=\"fas fa-arrow-up\"></i>\n              </a>{\" \"}\n            </h2>\n            <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n              Sometimes to help maintain good \"key lines\" it may be necessary to\n              adjust width on certain components to help align text inside of a\n              component with text that resides outside of it. Key lines are\n              invisible lines that help align elements to each other. A good\n              example would be blocks of text inside the same column that are\n              all aligned left.

Most\n              notably, the line-height of body copy (20px). This will form the\n              basis that all of the other spacing variables will follow. Why\n              this particular line height? Well body copy is the meat and\n              potatoes when it comes the information on the page. The space that\n              each of these lines of text occupies a sort of bell-weather status\n              indicating the minimum value of an element meant to communicate to\n              a user. It seems like a logical starting point for creating a\n              system.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n              Vertically speaking, all things align to the baseline grid. Every\n              single element on the page MUST be in an interval of 4px. No 1, 2,\n              3 etc. Because legibility is paramount, where typography goes so\n              too does everything else. Which is why all of a spacing variables\n              must also be a multiple of 4px.\n            </p>\n            {/* @TODO: add image helper */}\n\n            <h3 className=\"cbp-heading-3\">\n              Geometric Progression and Spacing Variables\n            </h3>\n            <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n              Just like how are typographic settings are tabulated with a\n              modular scale you could create a spacing scale based off of a\n              ratio. In this sense above our baseline we double the px in each\n              step, and below we half (rounded to the nearest 4px interval).\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n              Because our system is productive in nature, we need to take a\n              slightly altered approach. If we take the geometric approach on\n              the high end, starting at 20px we will get our large spacing\n              values by doubling at each step. Two large values seem to meet our\n              needs. On the lower end we use the 4px denominator to make\n              variables at 8, 12, and 16px. This should create a system that\n              should work for our needs and create more variety on the smaller\n              side of the scale.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"cbp-subhead-text\">\n              <em>\n                To view the full list of spacing variables, click on the{\" \"}\n                <a href=\"#Basics\">Basics tab</a> above.\n              </em>\n            </p>\n\n            <h2 className=\"cbp-heading-2\">\n              Rule of 3 \"C's\" (Containers, Components, Content)\n              <a\n                href=\"#Basics\"\n                className=\"cbp-heading-6\"\n                style={{ position: \"relative\", float: \"right\", right: \"3rem\" }}\n              >\n                Back to Top <i className=\"fas fa-arrow-up\"></i>\n              </a>{\" \"}\n            </h2>\n\n            <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n              <div role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"3\">\n                <strong>Containers</strong>\n              </div>\n              These are the highest level in relational hierarchy. These\n              elements hold other elements.

Headers, text, tables, etc.\n              Inline and stack principles are applied here. This is the spacing\n              between elements. IT DOES NOT REPLACE LINE HEIGHT. In the case of\n              spacing between 2 paragraphs within the same text box there needs\n              to be a separate setting to keep that value at 1.5x the line\n              height value (this only applies to body shouldn't have multiple\n              paragraphs within a header.) Another special case is the spacing\n              as applied to list items (unordered or ordered). Body paragraph\n              line height in this case is not usually sufficient and there will\n              likely need to be extra space on the vertical ends to help\n              separate from paragraphs when it is self contained.\n            </p>\n\n            <h2 className=\"cbp-heading-2\">\n              Spacing Philosophies\n              <a\n                href=\"#Basics\"\n                className=\"cbp-heading-6\"\n                style={{ position: \"relative\", float: \"right\", right: \"3rem\" }}\n              >\n                Back to Top <i className=\"fas fa-arrow-up\"></i>\n              </a>{\" \"}\n            </h2>\n            <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n              <div role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"3\">\n                <strong>\n                  Square Inset (relationship of container to contained elements\n                </strong>\n              </div>\n              This spacing style applies a constant px value around the element.{\" \"}\n              <em>\n                See the <a href=\"#Basics\"> Basics tab </a>above to view the full\n                list of available spacing classes.\n              </em>\n            </p>\n\n            <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n              <div role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"3\">\n                <strong>\n                  Squish Inset (relationship of container to contained elements)\n                </strong>\n              </div>\n              This style allows for asymmetrical spacing with the vertical\n              spacing being smaller than the horizontal spacing.

Roughly, the rule is the bigger the\n              object is, the bigger the space it needs between other objects on\n              the page to avoid tangents.
